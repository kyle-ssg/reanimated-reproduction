## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them


| Location                                                     | Suggested Version       |
| -------------                                                |:-------------:|
| <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a>                     | >= 6.0.0 |
| <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">npm</a>                        | >= 4.0.0 |

# Deployment with Now
Out the box, this setup supports deploying to https://zeit.co
```$xslt
npm i now -g
now
```

## Installing
```
npm i
```

## Running
**Development**

Hot reloading for client / server
```
npm run dev
```

## Deploying

Every branch gets deployed with Zeit. See the deployments tab in this GitHub.


## Testing with jest
allows component level, unit, saga and reducer testing
```
npm run test
```

## E2E tests with nightwatch
requires dependencies listed in tests/e2e/readme.md

```
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run a specific test suite

Edit a test suite to include a **tag**, e.g.:

```js
module.exports = {
  tags: ['wip'], // <-- this
  '<test name>': function (browser) {
    // ...
  },
};
```

Then:

```
npm run test:e2e -- --tag wip
```

## Generating pact tests files
Only really relevant if the backends use pact requires dependencies listed in tests/pact/readme.md

```
npm run test:pct
```

## Running a pact mock server 
Can be done regardless of if pact is installed
```
npm run test:pact:server
```

## ENV variables

Variables that differ per environment are exported globally to ``window.Project in`` [common/project.js](./common/project.js), this file gets replaced by a project.js located in [env](./env) by webpack based on what is set to the "ENV" environment variable (e.g. ENV=prod).
 
You can override each variable individually or add more by editing [environment.js](.env/environment-variables.js). 

e.g. with  ``API_URL=test npm run test`` Project.API will be "test"

## Storybook

This project uses storybook, running the project in dev mode will launch storybook on port 4000, this will render stories according to /stories/index.

## Web Entrypoint

pages/_app.js is where the initial app code is run


## Creating pages

As with any standard nextjs project you need to add any pages to /pages/url.js. See https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/navigate-between-pages/using-link.

There's a standardised Page component which will add any seo meta tags necessary. Usage:

```$xslt
          <Page title={Constants.titles.partners} canonical="partners">
               <div>Content</div>
          </Page>
```
