# Deployment with Now
Out the box, this setup supports deploying to https://zeit.co
```$xslt
npm i now -g
now
```

## Preinstall - using nvm and .nvmrc
In order to standardise the node environment of the team, this project uses an .nvmrc. In combination with nvm and the following [.bashrc/.zshrc setup](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#bash) this will ensure the correct node version is used whenever you ``cd`` into the directory. 

## Running
**Development**

Hot reloading for client / server
```
npm run dev
```

## Deploying

Every branch gets deployed with Zeit. See the deployments tab in this GitHub.


## Testing with jest
allows component level, unit, saga and reducer testing
```
npm run test
```

## Generating pact tests files
Only really relevant if the backends use pact requires dependencies listed in tests/pact/readme.md

```
npm run test:pct
```

## Running a pact mock server 
Can be done regardless of if pact is installed
```
npm run test:pact:server
```

## ENV variables

Variables that differ per environment are exported globally to ``window.Project in`` [common/project.js](./common/project.js), this file gets replaced by a project.js located in [env](./env) by webpack based on what is set to the "ENV" environment variable (e.g. ENV=prod).
 
You can override each variable individually or add more by editing [environment.js](env/environment-variables.js). 

e.g. with  ``API_URL=test npm run test`` Project.API will be "test"

## Storybook

This project uses storybook, running the project in dev mode will launch storybook on port 4000, this will render stories according to /stories/index.

## Web Entrypoint

pages/_app.js is where the initial app code is run


## Creating pages

As with any standard nextjs project you need to add any pages to /pages/url.js. See https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/navigate-between-pages/using-link.

There's a standardised Page component which will add any seo meta tags necessary. Usage:

```$xslt
          <Page title={Constants.titles.partners} canonical="partners">
               <div>Content</div>
          </Page>
```

## E2E
- To run e2e locally run ``npm run test:e2e``
- Make sure you have an env file at the root of the repository that has login credentials, or set them via env variables.
- If there is a CI image that has java/chrome installed you can run ``npm run test:e2e:prod``
- Make sure you have an env file at the root of the repository that has login credentials, or set them via env variables.
- If there is a CI image that has java/chrome installed you can run ``npm run test:e2e:prod``

## Adding react-native-web
- In order to not be too proprietary, react-native-web is not installed by default. To do so, look for the "REACT_NATIVE_WEB" comments

You'll need the following in package.json
```
    "react-native-globals": "^0.64.0",
    "react-native-reanimated": "2.2.2",
    "react-native-safe-area-context": "^3.3.2",
    "react-native-svg": "^12.1.1",
    "react-native-web": "^0.17.1",
    "react-native-web-lottie": "^1.4.4",
```

- add wrap _app with import BreakpointProvider from '../mobile/app/components/base/BreakpointProvider'
