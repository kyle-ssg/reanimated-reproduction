Follow the steps located here https://git.solidstategroup.com/solidstategroup/firebase-project-starter. After cloning the repo in step 1, copy the contents of the folder to the fire-auth folder in the boilerplate root directory. ```cd``` to the folder and continue following the remaining steps. Note that for step 4 you need to select hosting and for most of the other questions you simply hit enter except to "Do not overwrite index.html" which you should answer with "n"
